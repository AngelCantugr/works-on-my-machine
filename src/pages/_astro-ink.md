**Works On My Machine** is my tech blog where I document what I learn, build, and break. I write about systems, tooling, experiments, and the little things that make dev life smoother.

### What to expect
- Practical notes and tutorials
- Experiments and post-mortems
- Dev workflow and terminal craft
