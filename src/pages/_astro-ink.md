# Works on My Machine

I document what I'm building and learning.

I'm Angel Cantu, Software Engineer.
I like to experiment, build, and share what I learn.
Challenges are usually where the best lessons show up.

## Why This Blog Exists

This is my web journal for technology, experiments, and growth.
I write to contribute back by sharing practical lessons, patterns, and mistakes others can learn from.
"Works on My Machine" is partly a joke, partly a method: build, test, break, learn, repeat.

## What You'll Find Here

### Build

Projects, prototypes, and technical experiments I'm actively working on.
What I shipped, the tradeoffs I made, and what I'd change next time.

### Write

Technical notes and breakdowns in plain language.
Architecture decisions, implementation details, and lessons that survived contact with reality.

### Journal

Reflections from the day-to-day process.
What I'm learning, what I'm rethinking, and how my approach evolves over time.
