                <h1>About</h1>

                <p>I'm Angel Cantu, a Software Engineer.</p>

                <p>I built Works on My Machine as a place to document what I'm building and learning in public. This site is my running log of experiments, technical lessons, false starts, and progress over time.</p>

                <p>I like working close to the problem: build something, test it, break it, understand it, improve it. When a challenge shows up, I treat it as feedback. Most of my growth has come from that loop.</p>

                <p>I write about:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Technology and software engineering</li>
                    <li>Things I'm actively learning</li>
                    <li>Projects I'm building</li>
                    <li>Systems, habits, and decisions that help me keep momentum</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I also care about making technical ideas practical and accessible. If I learn something useful, I want to contribute it back in a way that helps someone else build faster, think clearer, or avoid a mistake.</p>

                <p>You'll find a mix of:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Technical posts</li>
                    <li>Learning-in-public notes</li>
                    <li>Journal-style reflections from ongoing work</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The name Works on My Machine is intentional. It captures the spirit of this blog: real-world building is messy, iterative, and full of edge cases. I'm here for that process.</p>
