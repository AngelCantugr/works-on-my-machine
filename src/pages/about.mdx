    I use this blog to share what I learn while building software: ideas, experiments, and the occasional deep dive. If it helped me, it might help you too.

    I enjoy RPGs, cyberpunk aesthetics, and terminal-driven workflows. Expect posts about tooling, productivity, and the fun parts of engineering.
